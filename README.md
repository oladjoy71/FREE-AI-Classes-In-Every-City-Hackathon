A Nigerian automobile company, Great Motors, has just employed you as their lead data scientist for the analytics division.  Great Motors deals in used cars, with a huge market base in Nigeria. The company has a unique platform where customers can buy and sell cars. A seller posts details about the vehicle for review by the companyâ€™s mechanic on the platform to ascertain the vehicle's value. The company then lists the car for sale at the best price. Great Motors makes its profit by receiving a percentage of the selling price listed on the company platform. To ensure the car's selling price is the best for both the customer selling the vehicle and Great Motors, you have been assigned the task of coming up with a predictive model for determining the price of the car.
